# Rock_Paper_Scissors
This repo is created for a project from The Odin Project. More information about the project on the README file.

The purpose of this project is to recreate the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. The game will be played entirely through console and is programmed in JavaScript.

In order to accomplish the project goals as fast as possible the project will not have a GUI. The main focus will be that the game logic is programmed correctly.
